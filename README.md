# codonStats
# a tool that i made when i got really sick of having to look at crappy amino acid charts. fully functional but very much in progress.
# imma be honest with you folks i don't really know what a readme is supposed to be
# sick protip: if you type in "all" instead of a codon when it starts up, it'll print em all. all of it. wonderful.
